  Checking Build System
  CMake is re-running because C:/Users/Elisey/Desktop/Projects/C++/GameEngine/build/GameEngineCore/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'C:/Users/Elisey/Desktop/Projects/C++/GameEngine/GameEngineCore/CMakeLists.txt'
    is newer than 'C:/Users/Elisey/Desktop/Projects/C++/GameEngine/build/GameEngineCore/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
    result='-1'
  CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
    No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
    contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
    code such as
  
      project(ProjectName)
  
    near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().
  
    CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
    line.
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
